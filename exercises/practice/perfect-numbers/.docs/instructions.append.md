## Assert

For this exercise, let's say that we want the caller to be responsible for calling `classify` only with a nonzero input.
So please make the `classify` function assert that its input is nonzero.
For more details, see the [Zig Language Reference][zig-reference] and the implementation of [`std.debug.assert`][assert].

However, note that this exercise does not currently test an input of 0 (because `std.testing` does [not yet support expecting a panic][proposal]).
