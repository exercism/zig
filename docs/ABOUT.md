Zig is a general-purpose programming language equipped with well-rounded toolchains that aims to be simple and familiar, yet disparate from what programmers rely on today. Its main attributes involve helping programmers to develop robust, optimal, and reusable software. All the while, Zig aims to remedy the design problems of older languages with features that promote safety through the use of [optionals][optionals], a unique take on [error handling][error-handling], and [compile-time utilities][compile-time].

From the ground up, Zig was designed to be competitive with other systems programming languages and not be reliant on them. With bold claims such as, "Zig is faster than C" featured on it's home page, being independent from other languages is a major design philosophy that it champions.

Zig has a lot of faculties that really makes it double down on it's notion of independence. The standard library that Zig provides harbors many common functions that perform fast to ensure that a reliance on FFI and external libraries is not essential. Zig also provides a well-rounded [build system][build-system] so that Zig is not dependent on alternative build tools, such as make, cmake, or ninja.

The home page for Zig is [ziglang.org][ziglang.org]. Zig provides a complete summary of the language's current features, grammars, and philosophies at [ziglang.org/documentation/master/][ziglang.org/docs]. It's highly recommended that newcomers use a mix of the documentation and other [community resources][zig-community] to learn Zig in a well-rounded fashion.
